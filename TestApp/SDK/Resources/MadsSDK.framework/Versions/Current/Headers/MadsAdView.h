/** The MadsAdView class can be used to embed advertisement content in your application. Simply create a MadsAdView and ad it to a UIView. You can set properties to customize the ad and the way it displays and animates on screen. Use the initWithFrame:zone:secret:delegate method to initialize a MadsAdView object. By setting a delegate that implements the MadsAdViewDelegate protocol you can follow progress on the ad loading and displaying content.
 
 Make sure you obtain a zone id and secret fro Mads so that the server can authenticate ad requests from you.
 
 The MadsAdView object handles all rendering and interactions of any content. It renders simple banners and rich media, all MRAID compatible ads.
 
 There are 2 types of MadsAdView ads, inline and overlay. An inline ad is part of your view hierarchy and will display ads within that hierarchy. An overlay ad will display in the keyWindow, and will therefore cover (part of) your interface. Note that if you want to create an overlay you do not have to ad the view to the keyWindow yourself. See below for a code example.
 
 If you want the adView to scale a little bigger if your UI allows it you can specify a minimum and maximum size of the ad with the minSize and maxSize properties.
 
 The MadsAdView will load content shortly after creation. The time it takes to start loading content is available to you to set additional properties. If you want the ad to load immediately you can call the update method. To see if an ad is loading you can check the isLoading property. The MadsAdView object will load new content after a specific time period. You can alter this by setting the updateTimeInterval property.
 
 You can specify an animation type for the appearance, and disappearance of a MadsAdView object. The object will not be visible until advertisement content has been loaded. Use the animationType property to set a specific animation type.
 
 If you want to send additional targeting data along in your ad request you can add key-value pairs to the additionalParameters property. These values will be used to target the advertisement shown on the device.
  
 If you want to debug ad behavior you can set the testMode and logMode properties of the MadsAdView. 
 
 Example Code, create an ad in 2 lines :
     // Notice that you do not need to keep the adView hidden. It will not be visible until content is loaded
     MadsAdView *adView = [[[MadsAdView alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(0.0, 0.0, 320.0, 50.0) 
                                                    zone:@"your_zone_id_here"
                                                  secret:@"your_secret_here"
                                                delegate:self] autorelease];
 
     [self.view addSubView:adView];
 
 
 Example Code, set some properties :
 
     adView.maxSize = CGSizeMake(320.0, 100.0); // this allows the adView to increase height to 100 if needed
     adView.gender = @"male"; // tell the adserver to target a male
     adView.madsAdType = MadsAdTypeOverlay; // request an overlay ad
     adView.animationType = MadsAdAnimationTypeTop; // animate the adview in from the top of the screen
     adView.updateTimeInterval = 120.0; // refresh the ad view with a new ad after 2 minutes
 
 Example code, create an overlay Ad :
 
     // Note that the Ad Server decides the size and position of the overlay ad, so
     // set the frame to CGRectZero
     MadsAdView *adView = [[[MadsAdView alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectZero 
     zone:@"your_overlay_zone_id_here"
     secret:@"your_overlay_secret_here"
     delegate:self] autorelease];

     adView.madsAdType = MadsAdTypeOverlay;
     // We add the AdView to our ViewController, and when the overlay ad is loaded
     // it will position itself in the [UIApplication sharedApplication].keyWindow
     [self.view addSubView:adView];
 
 @warning Some advice on using the MadsSDK:  
 
 For inline ads, do not visibly create space to fit the MadsAdView until the adview has actually loaded its content. Once the didReceiveAd delegate method fires, animate the MadsAdView into your current UI. The golden rule should be, if there is no ad content to display, do not show any trace of an ad space in your UI. The experience will be better when you animate the ad in when its ready. MadsAdView provides default animation options so that animtion becomes very easy to accomplish, see the property animationType.  
 
 Note that by default, the MadsAdView will be hidden until the ad content is loaded. No need to manage that yourself.  
 
 When to call update on a MadsAdView?  
 
 Call the update method whenever a user enters a context or UI that contains a MadsAdView. Remember that calling update is a relative expensive operation as content needs to be downloaded from the ad server. For example, if you add a MadsAdView to every page in a UIScrollView, you may end up calling update for every ad view when a user scrolles back and forth on pages (this can happen a lot). Instead, you may want to consider having one MadsAdView on top of the UIScrollView, so that refreshing only needs to be done once, when the user enters the view that contains the UIScrollView.
 
 If you retain a MadsAdview
 
 Be sure to release theMadsAdview in dealloc again. If you do not do this, then click behavior is not guaranteed anymore when the app goed in to the background and comes back to the foreground again (for example with ads that send the user to the app store or a web site).
